            <img src="img/yi-and-awards/yi-shooting.jpg" alt="yi-shooting" width="100%" class="yi-shooting">
            <p>
                I have been thinking that photography is the way of life. Photographers arrange the elements in an
                artistic way in a picture and call it composition. They shoot it and make it look like and feel like the
                way it should be in his/her mind and present to all. In fact, both life and photography are colorful,
                excited, elegant. Of course, sometimes both are boring, bitter and even brutal. That is how life goes.
                It might be beyond many people’s understanding that a teacher and researcher with Ph.D degree in
                Chemistry from Queen’s University and strong academic background like me will be addicted to photography
                and further shift to interactive media design at Algonquin College. To me, however, both are very
                interesting and no contradiction. Both needs imagination, both needs commitment, and both brings us
                tears and joyful.

                I want to capture the beauty all around us, I want to tell good stories using my camera, I also want to
                turn concepts into visual arts and incorporate great images to digital graphics full of creative
                imagination with professional eyes and insight. If photography and graphic design keep inspiring me, and
                I do have the talents, then why not experience more and go deeper before too late?

                <p>
                    Yi's studio portraits are great. He captured the cruical moment with skillfull use of light. Yi's
                    portrait was very well done, with excellent balance, clarity and attention to detail.
                    For environmental figurses, I can see how Yi worked through different locations and understood his
                    space, the location and visual dynamic. Stunning use of forground and background, while keeping his
                    images balanced, simple and uncluttered. excellent use of colour, scale and space. Excellent
                    connection with his subjects in his images.

                <p>
                    In the "Heavenly Horse Running in Kalajun Prairie in Xinjiang", Yi finds a way to capture the beauty
                    of movement throughout this work. Contrasting the dynamics of light and shadow; Yi’s image invokes
                    the feeling of separation, while letting the audience dream of passion and inspiration.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    Yi's photos are full of creation and imagination where many people may overlook. In his still life
                    photos, I like his lighting and composition very much. For sports, events and shows, he can capture
                    the fast moving moment without blurring. His abstract shots are increabaly impresive, just like
                    painting.
