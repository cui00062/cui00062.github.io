                        I love the intro to Home Made Soy Milk where we have Yi sleeping in the pink flowery covers. It
                        made for a very engaging introduction, pulled me into the video, and made it fun to watch.

                    <p>
                        As a recommendation for next time I'd love to see a little more of that opening narrative
                        introduced in the rest of the production. Perhaps have a hand creeping to get some soy milk
                        before it's ready only to be shushed away.

                        Yi, your video "Home Made Soy Milk" was actually extremely well done! I thought the video was
                        really well shot, all the clips are smooth and well thought out. I think you also did a really
                        good job capturing every step and making cuts at the correct times. You framed your subject
                        perfectly throughout the video, all the shots keep the subject in good perspective compared to
                        the rest of the room. You did not leave out any important details, and made sure to address
                        every step which is great!

                    </p>
                    <p>

                        If I have to give any advice, maybe adding some sort of extra colour grading or cinematic filter
                        to your clips could help bring everything together and give it a bit more of a professional
                        look, but regardless the footage still the great the way it is now! Overall great video Yi, stay
                        safe & healthy!

                        The video "Homemade Soy Milk" was awesome! I loved how you used the introduction to help create
                        a story to add context of the rest of the video. I think your post production skills are
                        fantastic as your clips transition well together!

                        As a suggestion I would increase the volume of the the audio as it could be hard to hear at
                        times.
