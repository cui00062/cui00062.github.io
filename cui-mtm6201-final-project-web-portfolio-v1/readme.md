A few thoughts on the final project.

This project is designed for self-promotion responsive website. I used what we have learned in class on design foundation, design thinking, UX/UI, response web design, etc. to design the logo first to promote myself by branding mainly my photos. The second part followed is the photography related contents, which include my featured awarded photos in the homepage banner and immediate seen photo gallery in the same page and more than 100 photos slide show was created and embedded in the portfolio page. Sample video clip was also included. Based on the muck-up created by XD, the portfolio responsive website has been built. 
Actually, the project is not just coding. It covers resume writing, post-production of high quality photos and videos. Art elements are needed to make the site design and layout look modern and appealing. It is indeed a comprehensive project. We are encouraged to demonstrate our creativity and skillfully use of as many tools as we can, and as we want. The software I am using in this project are mainly Lightroom (Lr), Photoshop (PS) (image postproduction), Illustrator (Ai) (logo design), Premier pro (Pr), Audition (Au) (video edit) and XD for mock-up. The work is heavy but I learned a lot through this training and practice.
I have encountered many challenges for this final project. To make all elements original, all high quality photos were shot by me in recently years. It took me a while to choose and do the post process. At this very crucial moment, my new PC bought this January is dead and I had to use my old but slow PC instead to complete the post production for both photos and videos. I believe that the slide show and sample video are both worth viewing. Please enjoy twice. 
For coding, the use of flex, grid and animation makes the site more appealing. The balance of color tone and font (size, family) is an art. This project inspired me to dig deeper than class participation and exercise. For example, embedding a video is interesting and the process is enjoyable. We were not required to do so, I made it through many tries. I am so happy to see my web is responsive in all different view size and browsers. 
I used online html and CSS validation method to check if my coding is correct. They passed although got some warnings. I ignored a few errors warnings beause some warnings make no sense after consulting our teacher and some solid reference. 
I have provided a folder in which four pages of desktop version muckup are included for your info. 
I do have more ideas to further improve the web design and coding. But time is really limited. Also, some of my dreamed effects may have to be completed by JS and PHP, which we will learn next term. I am looking forward to it.
Finally,  I am highly appreciated of Adamâ€™s excellent teaching, a very nice, responsible and knowledgeable teacher. Thank you!
